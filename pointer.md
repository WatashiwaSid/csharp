# .NET Related
## ADO.NET
- (ActiveX Data Object) is a data access technology from the Microsoft .NET framework that provides consistent access to data sources such as SQL Server and XML, and to data sources exposed through OLE-DB and ODBC.

## ASP.NET
- ASP.NET is a server-side web-application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages using the .NET platform.

## MSIL/CIL
- Microsoft Intermediate Language(MSIL) or otherwise knows as Common Intermediate Language (CIL) is the intermediate language binary instruction set defined wthin the Common Language  Infrastructure (CLI) of the .NET framwework.

## CLR
- Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the virtual machine component of the .NET framework that provides just-in-time(jit) compilation of the source code, type safety, and garbage collection services.

## DLL
- A dynamic link library (DLL), is a shared module or piece of code in Windows Development environment which may be used by several applications or assembly.

## Assembly
- An assembly in .NET is a fundamental unit of deployment, version control, reuse, activation scoping, and security permissions for .NET-based applications

## GAC
- Global Assembly Cache (GAC) is a machine-wide assembly cache for the .NET Common Language Infrastructure (CLI). The GACstores assemblies specifically designated to be shared by several applications on the computer.

# OOPS Related
## Inheritance
- Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class. This promotes code reusability, modularity, and facilitates the creation of a hierarchy of classes

## Abstraction
- Abstraction is a process where you show only “relevant” data and “hide” unnecessary details of an object from the user.

## Encapsulation
- Encapsulation is the process of combining data and functions into a single unit called class.

## Polymorphism
- Existence in multiple forms (overloading, overriding)

## "abstract" keyword
- The abstract keyword defines an abstract class. An abstract class cannot be instantiated on its own and is intended to be inherited by other classes.

## Interface
- An interface is a completely "abstract class", which can only contain abstract methods and properties.

## "base" keyword
- In C#, the base keyword is used to access members (methods, properties, fields, and constructors) of a base class from a derived class. (similar to *super* in java)

## "using" keyword
- It is used to include a namespace, which allows us to use the classes and methods in that namespace without fully qualifying them.

## "throw" keyword
- The throw keyword is used to explicitly raise an exception. It allows you to manually throw an exception, rather than relying on the runtime to throw one automatically.

## "finally" keyword
- The finally keyword is used in a try-catch-finally block to specify a block of code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.

## "virtual" keyword
-  The virtual keyword is used to declare a method, property, indexer, or event in a base class that can be overridden by a derived class.

## "sealed" keyword
- Defines a sealed class. A sealed class in C# is a class that cannot be inherited from by another class.

## Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
- Method overriding in C# is used to implement abstract or virtual methods. Overrding simply refers to extend or modify the virtual or abstract implementation of a inherited method.

## Method Overloading (Compile time polymorphism)
- Overloading refers to defining multiple instances of the same operators or methods. Method overloading allows us to define multiple instances of the same method with different number and types of arguments.

## Method Hiding
- Similar to method overriding, but we can also have a reimplementation of method that has not been declared virtual or abstract.

# Database Related
## Primary Key
- An attribute, or a set of attributes that uniquely identifies each tuple in a relation.

## Foreign Key
- A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.

## DataReader
- A DataReader in C#(ADO.NET) is a forward-only, read-only stream of data that allows you to access the results of a query or stored procedure without loading the entire result set into memory.

## Dataset
- A DataSet in C# is a disconnected architecture that represents relational data in a table structure. It’s a local copy of your database, existing in the local system, making your application execute faster and more reliable.

## DTS
- The Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime namespace provides classes and interfaces for working with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages in C#.
